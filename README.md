# Assignment 05
A binary tree is memorised in the following two ways:
- (node no-subtrees list-subtree-1 list-subtree-2 ...)  (1)
- (node (list-subtree-1) (list-subtree-2) ...)  (2)

Write recursive Lisp functions for the following problem:
- Return the level of a node X in a tree of type (1). The level of the root element is 0.
